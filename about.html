Hi, I’m Eben Nduwimana — a passionate software engineering student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at Kennesaw State University.

In 2023, I completed a software engineering internship at Publicis Sapient, where I gained hands-on experience working with real-world development teams and

deepened my understanding of scalable, user-centered solutions. I enjoy building clean, functional applications that combine thoughtful design with practical

utility. Some of my recent projects include: TrackPro – A full-stack project management tool for tracking software requirements and team hours.

Wells Fargo Clone – A front-end replica of the Wells Fargo homepage, focused on precision and responsive UI.

Meditation Now – A calming web app designed to introduce users to daily mindfulness practice.

My core tech stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and building user

experiences that feel intuitive and effective. Outside of development, I’m into personal growth, chess, and meditation. I believe great software comes from clarity 

— both in thought and execution. Currently, I’m focused on growing my backend skills and expanding my portfolio with projects that solve real problems. I’m always 

open to collaboration and learning opportunities — feel free to reach out!
